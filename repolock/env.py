"""The repo lock's membrane: every effect the lock depends on, and nothing else.

`repolock/lock.py` is pure logic over this module. Everything nondeterministic lives here —
the clock, process liveness, the lockfile on disk, and git — so that the boundary is one
import away and a lock trajectory can be recorded and replayed (see repolock/flight.py).

Keep this module dumb. No policy, no decisions: read the world, write the world, and let
lock.py judge. A function that branches on what it read belongs on the other side.

    pid <= 0 means "no PID was recorded", and the answer is True — *cannot disprove liveness*.
    That default is load-bearing, not lazy. Locks taken by a harness hook have no usable PID:
    the hook process exits the instant it returns, and its parent may be a short-lived shell
    rather than the agent itself. Recording either would make every hook-taken lock look dead
    within seconds, and a lock that looks dead gets stolen — silently destroying the one
    property this whole module exists to provide. So a PID-less lock degrades to lease-only
    liveness (a crashed holder waits out a short lease), and only a genuinely long-lived
    process supplies a PID it can vouch for.
