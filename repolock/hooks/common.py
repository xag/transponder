"""What every harness adapter shares: the parts of an adapter that are not the harness.

An adapter is a thin translation — harness event in, SPEC.md obligation out. The obligations
themselves are identical across harnesses, so they live here and each adapter keeps only its
vendor's wire format.

**v1: observe, do not predict.** There used to be a shell write-classifier here — word lists of
mutating git verbs and mutating commands, a redirect regex, a segment splitter — and it was wrong
in both directions, by construction:

  - it called reads writes. `print("a -> b")` was a redirect into a file named `b")`, so a session
    doing nothing but reading took the lock, and could be refused one (#7). The same false-positive
    class had already locked a two-session fleet out of its own repos once (#4).
  - it called writes reads, and always will. `npm install`, `make`, `uv run ruff --fix`,
    `python scripts/codegen.py` name nothing a list can hold. Deciding whether an arbitrary program
    writes to the tree means running it.

No amount of widening fixes either. The question was wrong. The right one — asked by SPEC.md §7a
and by the old code's own comments, which knew this — is not *"was this a write?"* but *"did the
repo change?"*, and that one is answered exactly, by looking:

  before a tool runs   take lock.fingerprint(repo)
  after it runs        take it again. It moved => that tool wrote. It is a fact, not a guess.

Two things follow, and they are the whole design:

  1. Where the harness hands us GROUND TRUTH, we still prevent. `Edit`/`Write`/`NotebookEdit` carry
     the path they will write, so the repo is known exactly and the lock is taken *before* the
     write, as it always was. No parsing, and no cwd guess either — the lock goes on the repo that
     owns the FILE, not the one the session happens to sit in (#8).
  2. Where it does not — a shell — we do not pretend. We refuse only what is provably unsafe (a live
     holder with a dirty tree: walking into someone's half-finished edits is the founding incident),
     and we DETECT the write afterwards, claiming the lock the moment the tree moves. The honest
     cost is a one-tool-call window in which a shell write is unguarded. v0.1 pretended to close
     that window and did not; this closes it from the second call on, and turns the case it cannot
     prevent into a collision it can *prove* and report, instead of silent corruption.

    """The one command the gate will let a BLOCKED session run — one spelling per shell.

    A refused session cannot run any shell here — that is the whole point of the refusal — and the
    background waiter that would let it go and do something else is itself a shell. So the gate
    mints the command, and then allows exactly that string and nothing else.

    This is a **capability, not a classification.** Nothing reads the command to judge what it does.
    The hook compares it, byte for byte, against strings it wrote itself; append a single character
    — `... && rm -rf src` — and it is a different string, matches nothing, and is gated like any
    other shell. That distinction is the entire difference between this and the thing that has now
    broken twice (#4, #7): recognising your own token is not the same act as understanding
    someone else's command.

    **Why two spellings, and why forward slashes.** The first version of this minted exactly one
    string, `f"{sys.executable} -m ..."`, with `sys.executable` unquoted and spelled the way Windows
    spells it: `C:\\Users\\...\\python.exe`. The gate accepted it, the model ran it verbatim, and
    bash ate every backslash as an escape — `C:UserstransProjects...python.exe: command not found`,
    exit 127. The waiter never ran ONCE, on any tape, in the library's whole history (xag/repolock#10).
    And because the refusal tells the session to launch it with `run_in_background`, dying instantly
    looked exactly like waking because the lock freed: the escape hatch did not merely fail, it
    failed by reporting success.

    So the command has to survive the shell it is pasted into, and there is no single string that
    survives both of the shells a harness may pick:

      sh    "C:/…/python.exe" …     quoted, so a space in the path is safe; forward slashes, so
                                    there is no backslash for bash to eat. A leading `&` would be
                                    a syntax error here.
      pwsh  & "C:/…/python.exe" …   PowerShell will not EXECUTE a quoted path without the call
                                    operator — it just echoes the string back — so `&` is required,
                                    and required to be absent above.

    Both are minted here and both are allowed, because both are ours. Forward slashes are safe on
    Windows: the OS, and Python's own `-m`, accept them everywhere.

    Deterministic in (session, repo), so the refusal can print them and the next PreToolUse can
    recognise them without any state having to survive in between.

    **The idle-dirty lock is not managed here; it is prevented.** The old rule was: dirty tree at
    handback => keep the lock and let the lease run out, on the grounds that handing over
    half-finished edits is worse than making the next session wait. Both halves of that were true,
    and the conclusion was still wrong, because it accepted the dirty handback as a given and then
    made everyone else pay for it. What it produced in practice (#11): a session parked on `chores`
    with an untracked `.devdata/` — an artifact directory, not work at all — and the next session
    was refused `ls && git log` for ten minutes.

    So we refuse the premise instead. A session may not walk away holding a lock on a mess: it is
    told to commit, ignore or stash, and the lock then releases itself against the clean tree. The
    dirty handoff never happens, so there is nothing to protect anyone from.

    `already_asked` is the harness's `stop_hook_active`, and it is what keeps this from being a
    cage. We ask ONCE. If the tree is still dirty on the way out a second time, the session has
    decided, and we fall back to the old behaviour — hold, mark idle, let the lease lapse. A gate
    that will not let a session stop is worse than any lock it could be protecting.

    That restraint is the whole of it, and it is not timidity — it is the protocol. Three things
    this library provides depend on an MCP call always getting through, and every one of them is
    needed at the moment the lock is at its worst:

      lock_wait      how a blocked session waits at all (`sleep` is a shell; the shell is what was
                     refused);
      lock_disable   the off switch, which must not be spelled as a command in a terminal the lock

                     reported in the first place.

    A gate across MCP would sit in front of all three, so there is no version of this that both
    gates MCP and keeps the escape hatch. We watch instead: settle_observed() reads the repo
    afterwards and claims the lock if the tree moved.

    A memo left behind here is inert — no lock rides on it, so a half-wired install (PostToolUse
    missing the mcp matcher) costs a stale file and nothing else. That is deliberate, and it is why
    this uses a memo of its own rather than FP_DIR: a surviving FP_DIR memo is how hold_unknown
    detects that the settle hook is not wired, and an MCP observation must never trip that alarm.
