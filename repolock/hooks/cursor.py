"""The Cursor hooks adapter — adapter #2, and the convention's first cross-tool test.

Same lockfile, same SPEC.md obligations, different wire format: Cursor hooks speak JSON on
stdin AND stdout (a blocking hook answers `{"permission": "allow"|"deny", ...}`), identity is
`conversation_id` (stable across turns), and there is no per-event cwd on lifecycle events —
those carry `workspace_roots` instead. One script serves every event; dispatch is on
`hook_event_name`.

Event mapping (SPEC.md §7):

  preToolUse            gate the file-editing tools. `deny` + agent_message when a live holder
                        is in the way; handoff and commit warnings ride `agent_message` on allow.
  beforeShellExecution  gate shell commands that write a working copy or its history.
  stop / sessionEnd     the idle boundary: release on a clean tree, hold-and-lapse on a dirty
                        one, for every workspace root.
  sessionStart          the read-side drift check, injected as `additional_context`.
  beforeSubmitPrompt    the same check on the way back in; drift surfaces as `user_message`
                        (this event's output has no agent channel), never blocks.

Install: `~/.cursor/hooks.json` (user scope), each event pointing at this script via a python
that can import `repolock`:

    {
      "version": 1,
      "hooks": {
        "preToolUse":           [{"command": "<python> <checkout>/repolock/hooks/cursor.py"}],
        "beforeShellExecution": [{"command": "<python> <checkout>/repolock/hooks/cursor.py"}],
        "stop":                 [{"command": "<python> <checkout>/repolock/hooks/cursor.py"}],
        "sessionEnd":           [{"command": "<python> <checkout>/repolock/hooks/cursor.py"}],
        "sessionStart":         [{"command": "<python> <checkout>/repolock/hooks/cursor.py"}],
        "beforeSubmitPrompt":   [{"command": "<python> <checkout>/repolock/hooks/cursor.py"}]
      }
