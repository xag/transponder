"""The repo lock's trajectory invariants — claims that hold on EVERY lock call (extra `flight`).

Recordings answer "same?"; invariants answer "right?". That distinction earns its keep here more
than anywhere else, because a lock's two catastrophic bugs are both unreproducible by
construction:

  - two sessions holding the same working copy at once
  - a lock nobody can take back after its holder crashed

Neither can be re-staged by hand — each depends on a clock, a PID and an interleaving you do not
control. But both are *claims about a single trajectory*, and a claim can be checked against any
recording, including the one that first caught the bug. A pinned recording of a lock that was
wrongly granted would reproduce faithfully and prove nothing; these condemn it.

RULE, learned the hard way while writing these: an invariant must judge from what the BOUNDARY
said, never from what the code concluded. The first draft of `exclusion_holds` read acquire's own
`prior_live` local — so a bug in the liveness logic would have been read straight out of the
trace, agreed with, and passed. An oracle that trusts the reasoning it exists to audit cannot
condemn that reasoning. So liveness is *recomputed* below from the three recorded facts (the
record on disk, the clock, the PID answer), and the code's opinion is ignored.

Write each claim as the property, not the check; guard result-readers with `t.raised`.
