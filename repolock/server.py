"""Repo Scope — a local (stdio) MCP server: the negotiation channel for shared checkouts.

The hooks (repolock/hooks/claude_code.py) are the courier and the witness: they inform agents and
observe writes, and they never refuse a tool call. This server is the channel those notes point at
— where an agent says what it will write, sees what everyone else said, and where a human (or a
wedged session) turns the whole thing off.

Run (local only, extra `mcp`): `uv run python -m repolock.server`   (register in your client)

Identity: a claim is declared BY an agent about itself, so every scope tool takes the agent's own
harness `session_id` — the same id the hooks see. Passing a name for yourself is not the identity
problem the old lock server had (it refused to guess who it was acting for); saying who YOU are is
exactly the declaration the protocol wants.

    — and you out of theirs.**

    Nothing is enforced and nothing is blocked: the map is information, the witness reports what
    actually happens against it, and the agents — who all work for the same human — keep out of
    each other's regions because breaking each other's work serves nobody.

    `scope` is a list of **filesystem paths** — one namespace, whose overlap is always computable,
    so a conflict names the exact intersection instead of guessing:

        "src/api/**"     a subtree (relative paths resolve against `repo`)
        "src/api/x.py"   one file
        ".git/index"     THE STAGING AREA — reserve it around a commit and release it after.
                         `git add -A` sweeps up every dirty file in the checkout, including the
                         half-finished work of the agent next door. Reserve the index, stage YOUR
                         paths by name, commit, release.
        "**"             the whole checkout

    Spelling does not matter — case, symlinks, `..` all resolve to one canonical path, so two
    agents cannot hold one file under two names.

    `session_id` is your harness session id — the same one the hooks see. Pass it exactly.

    Returns `granted`, or a `conflict` naming who holds what, the exact OVERLAP to subtract, and
    what is free right now. A conflicting scope is not registered (the map never double-books a
    region), but nothing stops your work — take a narrower scope, or split the work and file an
    issue for the part that is theirs. Do NOT just write into their region: the witness will see
    it, and both of you will be told.
