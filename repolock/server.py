"""Repo Lock — a local (stdio) MCP server for seeing and overriding the working-copy lock.

The lock itself is taken and released automatically by a harness hook (for Claude Code:
repolock/hooks/claude_code.py); a model never has to remember to call anything, which is the
only reason the guarantee is worth having. This server is the *visibility and override* surface
on top of it — the questions a session actually needs answered when it walks into a locked repo.

Run (local only, extra `mcp`): `uv run python -m repolock.server`   (register in your client)

A note on identity, deliberately conservative. A stdio MCP server has no reliable way to learn
the harness session id that owns it, and the hook keys locks on exactly that id. Rather than
invent a second, mismatched notion of "who I am" — which would let this server release a lock it
does not own, or take one that fights the hook's — the tools here are either read-only or an
explicit, human-asked-for override. Acquiring is the hook's job alone. If a harness later
exposes the session id to MCP servers, `lock_repo`/`unlock_repo` become a five-line addition;
until then, a wrong identity model would be worse than no tool.
