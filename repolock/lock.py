"""A mutex over a local working copy, for the several agent sessions that share one.

Git assumes one working tree per developer. On a machine running parallel AI agent sessions
that assumption is false: several sessions edit the same checkout, and nothing in git or its
hosting cares. This is the missing lock. The on-disk convention it implements is SPEC.md, in
this repository — this module is the reference implementation, not the definition.

The shape, in one breath: a lock is **short-lived** and taken right before writing; it carries a
**lease** whose duration the acquirer declares; the lease is renewed by *activity* (a harness
hook renews on every tool call — a tool call IS the activity, so no daemon exists to supervise);
it is **anchored to the commit** it was taken at, so the next writer inherits a diff rather than a
surprise; and it is **released explicitly, only against a clean tree**.

Two distinct failures are in scope, and they want different halves of this:
  - two writers colliding      → the lock (mutual exclusion)
  - a *stale reader*           → the commit anchor + `drift()`  (the incident that started
                                 this, 2026-07-12: history was rebased under a session that
                                 held no lock and was merely reasoning about commits that had
                                 moved)

Everything nondeterministic — clock, PID liveness, lockfile, git — is in repolock/env.py. This
module decides; that module touches the world.
