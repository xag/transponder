"""The channel the agents can repurpose (ledger: a-channel-they-can-repurpose).

A claim says where an agent is working and what it is doing. This is for everything after that: an
estimate that slipped, a shape that changed, a question, an answer. Two sessions in one checkout are
not rivals — they are building one app — and knowing that a rewrite of the auth middleware is COMING
changes how you write the module next to it.

It earns its keep in the case the protocol does not prevent. NOT CLEAR is not a refusal: an agent
can weigh it and declare overlapping work anyway, and sometimes that is the right call. Two agents
who know they are close have every reason to be talkative, and to be listening. Before this, a
conflict ended with "file an issue for their part" — which is what you write when there is no
channel.

Three addresses, because the list of addressees has to be unambiguous:

    direct       one agent, by session id. The only kind that is PUSHED into a recipient.
    channel      one checkout. Everybody working that repo can read it; nobody is served it.
    broadcast    this machine. Same.

IT STAYS A TRANSPONDER, NOT A CHATTER PHONE. Chat traffic and the scope-violation alarm share one
delivery path, and an agent taught to skim the channel skims the alarm with it. So broadcast and
channel are PULL-ONLY: an agent that wants the room asks for it, and one that has been hit once
will ask.

Reading is not destructive. Each message is a file; each reader keeps a set of the ids it has seen.
So a message addressed to several agents is cleared for the one that read it and stands for the
rest — which a delete-on-read queue cannot do, and which also lets an agent re-read what it was told
(`mark=False`).

NO WAKE-UP, and it is stated here because it will otherwise be discovered as a hang: nothing can
push into a running turn. A reply lands when the other side next fires a hook, or never, if it has
finished. This carries "I will need api/** when you are done" perfectly well and cannot carry a
handshake.
