"""Repo Scope — a local (stdio) MCP server: the negotiation channel for shared checkouts.

The hooks (transponder/hooks/claude_code.py) are the courier and the witness: they inform agents and
observe writes, and they never refuse a tool call. This server is the channel those notes point at
— where an agent says what it will write, sees what everyone else said, and where a human (or a
wedged session) turns the whole thing off.

Run (local only, extra `mcp`): `uv run python -m transponder.server`   (register in your client)

Identity: a claim is declared BY an agent about itself, so every scope tool takes the agent's own
harness `session_id` — the same id the hooks see. Passing a name for yourself is not the identity
problem the old lock server had (it refused to guess who it was acting for); saying who YOU are is
exactly the declaration the protocol wants.

    """**Declare the files and folders you intend to EDIT, before you edit them.**

    `repo` is the checkout you will WRITE TO — not the one you are sitting in. They are the same
    most of the time and they are not the same when it matters: a lib and its client, a tool and the
    project it is being run against. Declare once per checkout you will touch; nothing stops you
    holding regions in two.

    THE MAP IS THE WATCH LIST. Nothing observes a region nobody declared — a write there is neither
    reported to you nor to anyone else, because a violation only exists against a claim. Declaring
    is not paperwork you do for other agents' benefit; it is how your own work becomes something the
    witness can see being trampled.

    Nothing is enforced and nothing is blocked: the map is information, the witness reports what
    actually happens against it, and the agents — who all work for the same human — keep out of
    each other's regions because breaking each other's work serves nobody.

    `scope` is a list of **filesystem paths** — one namespace, whose overlap is always computable,
    so a conflict names the exact intersection instead of guessing:

        "src/api/**"     a subtree (relative paths resolve against `repo`)
        "src/api/x.py"   one file
        ".git/index"     THE STAGING AREA — reserve it around a commit and release it after.
                         `git add -A` sweeps up every dirty file in the checkout, including the
                         half-finished work of the agent next door. Reserve the index, stage YOUR
                         paths by name, commit, release.
        "**"             the whole checkout

    Spelling does not matter — case, symlinks, `..` all resolve to one canonical path, so two
    agents cannot hold one file under two names.

    `session_id` is your harness session id — the same one the hooks see. Pass it exactly.

    Returns `granted`, or a `conflict` naming who holds what, the exact OVERLAP to subtract, and
    what is free right now. A conflicting scope is not registered (the map never double-books a
    region), but nothing stops your work — take a narrower scope, or split the work and file an
    issue for the part that is theirs. Do NOT just write into their region: the witness will see
    it, and both of you will be told.

    Send this the moment your work would surprise someone reading the same checkout — you are about

    that will look broken if they read it now. The map already says WHERE you are writing; it cannot
    say what you are DOING, and that is the part that changes what someone else should write. "I am
    replacing the auth middleware's return type this hour" lets the agent next door write the caller
    once, for the new shape, instead of twice.

    You are not rivals. Two agents in one checkout are building one app for one person.

    Addressing, and it is deliberate that only one of these interrupts anybody:

        (default)        the CHANNEL for this checkout — everyone working `repo` can read it

                         region, or telling a holder when you will be done
        everyone=True    BROADCAST to every agent on this machine. Rare — cross-repo news only

    Channel and broadcast are PULL-ONLY: they wait until someone calls `messages()`. That is on
    purpose. Your note shares a delivery path with the scope-violation alarm, and an agent trained
    to skim the channel skims the alarm with it — so this stays a transponder, not a chat room.

    THERE IS NO WAKE-UP. Nothing can interrupt a running agent, so a reply arrives when the other
    side next fires a hook, or never, if it has finished. Write letters, not handshakes: "I will need
    api/** when you are done" is well carried; "reply before I continue" will hang forever.
