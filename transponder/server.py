"""Repo Scope — a local (stdio) MCP server: the negotiation channel for shared checkouts.

The hooks (transponder/hooks/claude_code.py) are the courier and the witness: they inform agents and
observe writes, and they never refuse a tool call. This server is the channel those notes point at
— where an agent says what it will write, sees what everyone else said, and where a human (or a
wedged session) turns the whole thing off.

Run (local only, extra `mcp`): `uv run python -m transponder.server`   (register in your client)

Identity: a claim is declared BY an agent about itself, so every scope tool takes the agent's own
harness `session_id` — the same id the hooks see. Passing a name for yourself is not the identity
problem the old lock server had (it refused to guess who it was acting for); saying who YOU are is
exactly the declaration the protocol wants.

    Send this the moment your work would surprise someone reading the same checkout — you are about

    that will look broken if they read it now. The map already says WHERE you are writing; it cannot

    replacing the auth middleware's return type this hour" lets the agent next door write the caller
    once, for the new shape, instead of twice.

    You are not rivals. Two agents in one checkout are building one app for one person.

    Addressing, and it is deliberate that only one of these interrupts anybody:

        (default)        the CHANNEL for this checkout — everyone working `repo` can read it

                         region, or telling a holder when you will be done
        everyone=True    BROADCAST to every agent on this machine. Rare — cross-repo news only

    Channel and broadcast are PULL-ONLY: they wait until someone calls `messages()`. That is on
    purpose. Your note shares a delivery path with the scope-violation alarm, and an agent trained
    to skim the channel skims the alarm with it — so this stays a transponder, not a chat room.

    THERE IS NO WAKE-UP. Nothing can interrupt a running agent, so a reply arrives when the other
    side next fires a hook, or never, if it has finished. Write letters, not handshakes: "I will need
    api/** when you are done" is well carried; "reply before I continue" will hang forever.
