"""The off switch — and the on switch. `python -m transponder.toggle off | on | status`.

The predecessor of this module switched off a LOCK that had taken the machine down four times
(#4, #7, #10, #11). The lock is gone — nothing here refuses a tool call any more — but the switch
stays, because an information layer can still be wrong, noisy, or slow, and off must mean off:

  It must reach a session that is ALREADY RUNNING. A harness snapshots its hooks when it starts, so
  removing them from settings.json does nothing for sessions already up. Only a file on disk,
  checked on every hook call, gets through: `~/.transponder/DISABLED` (env.disabled). Instant.

  The real surface is the MCP tools (`lock_disable` / `lock_enable` in transponder/server.py), so a
  running agent can reach it without a terminal. This CLI is the same two functions for a human.

The two dimensions are deliberately separate, and `status` reports both:

  ARMED    the panic file exists → every adapter no-ops. Reaches running sessions. Instant.
  WIRED    the hooks are in settings.json → new sessions will run the adapter at all.

`off` arms; `on` disarms AND re-wires, because a transponder that says it is on while its hooks are
missing is the worst of the three states — it guards nothing and tells you it is guarding.
