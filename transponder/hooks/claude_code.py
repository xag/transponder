"""The Claude Code adapter: the courier and the witness, wired into the harness — adapter #1.

This hook used to be a gate. It refused tool calls, held a mutex through every shell, and took the
machine down four times doing it (#4, #7, #10, #11). It is now an information layer, and the rule
that replaced all of that fits in one line:

    **No tool call is ever refused.** Not for an undeclared session, not for a write into someone
    else's region, not for anything. exit 2 exists in exactly one place — the Stop boundary, where
    a DEPARTING agent is asked once not to leave a dirty tree behind. That blocks no other agent,
    ever.

Four events, two jobs:

  PreToolUse   the courier: introduce a shared checkout (once), warn when a declared write is about
               to land in another agent's region — information at its most valuable moment, and
               still not a gate. For shells and MCP calls, take the witness's before-picture.

  PostToolUse  the witness: diff the picture. Unmoved => it read, nothing is said. Moved into
               another agent's declared region => the loudest thing this library says, with the
               remedy attached — a violation is a fact, not a guess, and it must not be silent.

  Stop         release this session's claims here against a clean tree; ask ONCE about a dirty one.

  SessionStart the drift check: has history moved under what this session remembers?

Install: a `hooks` block in ~/.claude/settings.json (user scope, so every repo on the machine is
covered) wiring all four events — `python -m transponder.toggle on` writes it. The matchers include
`mcp__.*` so MCP calls are witnessed; they are never, under any circumstance, refused.

Kill switch: `~/.transponder/DISABLED` (see env.disabled) makes every event a no-op, including in
sessions that already snapshotted their hooks. An informer cannot wedge the machine the way the
lock could, but it can be wrong or noisy, and off must still mean off, everywhere, instantly.
