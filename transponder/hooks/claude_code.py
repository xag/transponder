"""The Claude Code adapter: the courier and the witness, wired into the harness — adapter #1.

This hook used to be a gate. It refused tool calls, held a mutex through every shell, and took the
machine down four times doing it (#4, #7, #10, #11). It is now an information layer, and the rule
that replaced all of that fits in one line:

    **No tool call is ever refused.** Not for an undeclared session, not for a write into someone
    else's region, not for anything. exit 2 exists in exactly one place — the Stop boundary, where
    a DEPARTING agent is asked once not to leave a dirty tree behind. That blocks no other agent,
    ever.

Four events, two jobs:

  PreToolUse   the courier: hand over whatever is waiting for this agent, and remember any write it
               makes that no claim of its own covers. Cheap on purpose — no git, no snapshots — so
               it can run on every call.

  Stop         release this session's claims here against a clean tree; ask ONCE about a dirty one.

  SessionStart the drift check: has history moved under what this session remembers?

  UserPromptSubmit
               THE ASK. The one event that is both before the model acts and AFTER the human has
               said what the work is — so it carries the shared-checkout intro (once) and, for a
               session that keeps writing without a claim, the list of what it has written.

Install: a `hooks` block in ~/.claude/settings.json (user scope, so every repo on the machine is
covered) wiring all four events — `python -m transponder.toggle on` writes it. The matchers include
`mcp__.*` so MCP calls are witnessed; they are never, under any circumstance, refused.

Kill switch: `~/.transponder/DISABLED` (see env.disabled) makes every event a no-op, including in
sessions that already snapshotted their hooks. An informer cannot wedge the machine the way the
lock could, but it can be wrong or noisy, and off must still mean off, everywhere, instantly.

    looks identical whether someone reads it or not.

    `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` is the channel that reaches the model without blocking
    the call, which keeps the one rule this library will not break: nothing is ever refused.

    TOOL RESULT — after the write has landed. No non-blocking pre-execution channel exists in this
    harness; the only thing that reaches a model before its tool runs is exit 2, which refuses the
    call. The pre-write warning was deleted rather than reworded (see common.py where heads_up
