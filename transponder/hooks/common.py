"""What every harness adapter shares: the courier and the witness. Nothing here refuses anything.

This file used to be a lock. It held a mutex through every shell, minted one-time tickets so that
refused sessions could wait, detected its own half-wired installs, and grew a new organ every time
the gate hurt someone (#4, #7, #10, #11). All of that is gone, and it is gone on purpose: the
project stopped blocking agents and started informing them. What remains is exactly two jobs:

  THE COURIER   tell an agent what it cannot see from inside its own context: who else is working
                this checkout and where (shared_note, once); that history moved under it
                (drift_note). Notes reach the model as `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` —
                NOT as stdout, which goes to a debug log and reached nobody for the whole life of
                v2. It is the one channel that informs a running agent without refusing its call,
                and it lands beside the tool result: the courier speaks between calls, never before
                one. That is why there is no pre-write warning here any more.

  THE WITNESS   observe what a tool call actually did (witness.snapshot before, diff after), and
                when a write lands inside another agent's declared region, say so LOUDLY, to the
                agent that did it, with the remedy attached. The claims registry says who intends
                what; the witness says what happened; the difference, delivered immediately, is the
                entire enforcement model.

One deliberate exception to "never refuses": hand_back may block the STOP of an agent that is
walking away from a dirty tree — once, to ask it to commit, ignore or stash. That refuses no other
agent anything, ever; it asks the departing agent itself not to leave a mess for the humans and
agents that come next. It is kept because demoting it to a note would make it prose that cannot
fire, which is the failure this project exists to kill.

# heads_up() stood here: the pre-write warning for Edit/Write, checked against the map BEFORE the
# write landed. It is deleted, not disabled, because THE MOMENT IT WAS WRITTEN FOR DOES NOT EXIST.
#
# A hook cannot put text in front of a Claude Code agent before its tool runs without refusing the
# call: plain stdout goes to a debug log, and `additionalContext` from PreToolUse is delivered next
# to the TOOL RESULT — after the write. The only pre-execution channel is exit 2, which blocks, and
# this library does not block. So the warning arrived after the thing it warned about, wearing the
# grammar of a warning ("if you write it anyway..."), addressed to an agent that already had.
#
# Keeping it would have meant two code paths saying the same thing at the same moment in different
# words, and a docstring promising a guarantee the harness cannot give. Edit/Write now settle
# exactly like a shell: observed after, reported as a fact, remedy attached. One path, one moment,
# one wording — and observe-do-not-predict was always the honest form of this.
#
# What genuinely still arrives BEFORE any write is not here and does not need to be: the
# `declare_scope` conflict answer (an MCP reply, straight into the agent's context) and the
# shared-checkout intro at UserPromptSubmit/SessionStart, whose stdout the harness does put in
# front of the model.
#
# One behaviour left with it: a participant writing UNCLAIMED ground used to have its claim
# silently extended. settle() covers that case as a note asking for extend_scope() — the same
# treatment a shell has always had, and it does not mutate the map behind the agent's back.

# call, settle() diffed it after, and anything that had moved inside somebody else's region was
# reported. It is deleted, and the reason is not that it was expensive — it was that it could not
# do the one thing it claimed. A fingerprint proves the TREE MOVED. It cannot prove who moved it,
# and with two agents running that is not a corner case, it is the normal case: a holder appending
# to its own declared file and a passer-by whose call merely lasted longer than the gap between
# two of those appends produce the same picture from outside. It said so out loud four times in one
# afternoon, naming a reader as the author of writes it never made, and telling the holder its work
# had been trampled by an agent that never wrote a byte.
#
# So detection is gone, and nothing replaces it. The agreement happens BEFORE the work, in
