"""What every harness adapter shares: the courier and the witness. Nothing here refuses anything.

This file used to be a lock. It held a mutex through every shell, minted one-time tickets so that
refused sessions could wait, detected its own half-wired installs, and grew a new organ every time
the gate hurt someone (#4, #7, #10, #11). All of that is gone, and it is gone on purpose: the
project stopped blocking agents and started informing them. What remains is exactly two jobs:

  THE COURIER   tell an agent what it cannot see from inside its own context: who else is working
                this checkout and where (shared_note, once, at the first prompt rather than at
                arrival); that history moved under it (drift_note); and what it has itself written
                without a claim covering it (undeclared_note, on a doubling schedule, because once
                is how a nine-hour session ends up never having declared anything at all). Notes
                reach the model as `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` —
                NOT as stdout, which goes to a debug log and reached nobody for the whole life of
                v2. It is the one channel that informs a running agent without refusing its call,
                and it lands beside the tool result: the courier speaks between calls, never before
                one. That is why there is no pre-write warning here any more.

  THE WITNESS   observe what a tool call actually did (witness.snapshot before, diff after), and
                when a write lands inside another agent's declared region, say so LOUDLY, to the
                agent that did it, with the remedy attached. The claims registry says who intends
                what; the witness says what happened; the difference, delivered immediately, is the
                entire enforcement model.

One deliberate exception to "never refuses": hand_back may block the STOP of an agent that is
walking away from a dirty tree — once, to ask it to commit, ignore or stash. That refuses no other
agent anything, ever; it asks the departing agent itself not to leave a mess for the humans and
agents that come next. It is kept because demoting it to a note would make it prose that cannot
fire, which is the failure this project exists to kill.

    It used to introduce ONE CHECKOUT, chosen from the session's cwd, which meant an agent was told
    about its neighbours only if it happened to be sitting in the same folder as them — and an agent
    editing across checkouts (the ordinary case for anyone with a lib and its client open) was told
    nothing at all. Guessing where an agent is was never necessary here: the thing it needs to know
    is that the machine is shared and that it should say what it will edit.

    IT ALSO USED TO REQUIRE SOMEBODY ELSE TO BE ON THE MAP ALREADY — `if not claims: return None` —
    and that is the one condition under which it cannot do its job. The map starts empty. The first
    agent of the day was therefore told nothing, so it declared nothing, so the map was STILL empty
    when the second agent arrived an hour later, so that one was told nothing either: two agents in
    one checkout, each invisible to the other, for a whole working day, until a human noticed and
    said use the transponder. The intro is what bootstraps the map, so it cannot be gated on the map
    being non-empty; the empty map is precisely when nobody has been told yet.

    So it speaks either way, and it says which way it is — an empty map is a real fact about the
    machine, not a reason for silence. At most twice per session: once on arrival, and once more if
    an agent that was introduced to an empty map is later joined by someone, because "you are alone"
    is the one thing this note can say that stops being true on its own.

    On an empty map it needs one thing back: `cwd`, and a checkout there. Somebody else's live claim
    is reason enough to introduce an agent wherever it is sitting (it may be editing across

# call: plain stdout goes to a debug log, and `additionalContext` from PreToolUse is delivered next

# one wording — and observe-do-not-predict was always the honest form of this.

# and the silence is not the bug on its own — the placement is. The intro used to be spent at
# SessionStart, which is BEFORE the human has said what the work is, so it asked "what will you
# write to?" at the one moment in the session when that question has no answer. By the time it had
# one, the note was hundreds of thousands of tokens back, or gone through compaction.

# The witness stood here: watch() took a fingerprint of every checkout on the map before a tool
# call, settle() diffed it after, and anything that had moved inside somebody else's region was
# reported. It is deleted, and the reason is not that it was expensive — it was that it could not
# do the one thing it claimed. A fingerprint proves the TREE MOVED. It cannot prove who moved it,
# and with two agents running that is not a corner case, it is the normal case: a holder appending
# to its own declared file and a passer-by whose call merely lasted longer than the gap between
# two of those appends produce the same picture from outside. It said so out loud four times in one
# afternoon, naming a reader as the author of writes it never made, and telling the holder its work
# had been trampled by an agent that never wrote a byte.
#
# So detection is gone, and nothing replaces it. The agreement happens BEFORE the work, in
# declare_work(), which is the only moment anybody actually knows what they are about to do. An
# agent that suspects something changed under it asks the channel and can write to whoever it finds
# there. That is weaker, and it is honest, and it does not manufacture facts.
