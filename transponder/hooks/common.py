"""What every harness adapter shares: the courier and the witness. Nothing here refuses anything.

This file used to be a lock. It held a mutex through every shell, minted one-time tickets so that
refused sessions could wait, detected its own half-wired installs, and grew a new organ every time
the gate hurt someone (#4, #7, #10, #11). All of that is gone, and it is gone on purpose: the
project stopped blocking agents and started informing them. What remains is exactly two jobs:

  THE COURIER   tell an agent what it cannot see from inside its own context: who else is working
                this checkout and where (scope.touching); that the file it is about to edit sits in
                another agent's declared region (heads_up); that history moved under it (drift_note).
                Notes ride the hook's stdout into the agent's context on its next tool call — the
                one channel that reaches a running agent without interrupting it.

  THE WITNESS   observe what a tool call actually did (witness.snapshot before, diff after), and
                when a write lands inside another agent's declared region, say so LOUDLY, to the
                agent that did it, with the remedy attached. The claims registry says who intends
                what; the witness says what happened; the difference, delivered immediately, is the
                entire enforcement model.

One deliberate exception to "never refuses": hand_back may block the STOP of an agent that is
walking away from a dirty tree — once, to ask it to commit, ignore or stash. That refuses no other
agent anything, ever; it asks the departing agent itself not to leave a mess for the humans and
agents that come next. It is kept because demoting it to a note would make it prose that cannot
fire, which is the failure this project exists to kill.
