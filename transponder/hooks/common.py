"""What every harness adapter shares: the courier and the witness. Nothing here refuses anything.

This file used to be a lock. It held a mutex through every shell, minted one-time tickets so that
refused sessions could wait, detected its own half-wired installs, and grew a new organ every time
the gate hurt someone (#4, #7, #10, #11). All of that is gone, and it is gone on purpose: the
project stopped blocking agents and started informing them. What remains is exactly two jobs:

  THE COURIER   tell an agent what it cannot see from inside its own context: who else is working
                this checkout and where (shared_note, once); that history moved under it
                (drift_note). Notes reach the model as `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` —
                NOT as stdout, which goes to a debug log and reached nobody for the whole life of
                v2. It is the one channel that informs a running agent without refusing its call,
                and it lands beside the tool result: the courier speaks between calls, never before
                one. That is why there is no pre-write warning here any more.

  THE WITNESS   observe what a tool call actually did (witness.snapshot before, diff after), and
                when a write lands inside another agent's declared region, say so LOUDLY, to the
                agent that did it, with the remedy attached. The claims registry says who intends
                what; the witness says what happened; the difference, delivered immediately, is the
                entire enforcement model.

One deliberate exception to "never refuses": hand_back may block the STOP of an agent that is
walking away from a dirty tree — once, to ask it to commit, ignore or stash. That refuses no other
agent anything, ever; it asks the departing agent itself not to leave a mess for the humans and
agents that come next. It is kept because demoting it to a note would make it prose that cannot
fire, which is the failure this project exists to kill.

# call: plain stdout goes to a debug log, and `additionalContext` from PreToolUse is delivered next
# to the TOOL RESULT — after the write. The only pre-execution channel is exit 2, which blocks, and

# grammar of a warning ("if you write it anyway..."), addressed to an agent that already had.

# words, and a docstring promising a guarantee the harness cannot give. Edit/Write now settle
