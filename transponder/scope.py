"""Negotiated scopes — SPEC. Pure logic over `env`; every effect is on the boundary and on tape.

**This is a TRIAL (SPEC §8).** The claim it tests is not about code, it is about behaviour:
*agents will contain their work once containment is visible and rewarded.* It cannot be settled by
argument, and it cannot be settled from v1's tapes either — those record agents who were never
offered the deal, and reasoning from them is the Lucas critique. So it is run, with the recorder on,
and §11b's falsifiers decide.

**The namespace is the local filesystem.** Every resource in a scope is a canonical absolute path —
realpath + normcase, the same canonicalisation the lockfile has always used for repos — either one
file or a subtree (`.../**`). One namespace, one overlap relation (the prefix), and the conflict
answer can always name the exact INTERSECTION, so "come back narrower" is computed rather than
guessed. There are no other namespaces, and that is the point:

  - `git:index` was never anything but a file. It is `<repo>/.git/index` — reserve it like any
    path before you commit, release it after. `git:HEAD` is `<repo>/.git/HEAD`. The resources
    §1a made special collapse into ordinary paths, with no second overlap relation to get wrong.
  - aliasing is dead on arrival: two spellings of one file (case, symlinks, junctions, `..`)
    canonicalise to one string, so "whom do we inform?" is always answerable and never broadcast —
    the claim store is the routing table, and overlap computes the addressees.
  - what does not fit a filesystem (a port, a service) is not reservable, deliberately. A name
    without a witness is a contract nobody can check; it can earn its way in later.

**Nothing here refuses anything.** A conflicting `declare` is not recorded — the registry will
not double-book a region — but no tool call is ever blocked on account of it: the agent is told who
holds what, down to the exact intersection, and decides for itself. The registry is a shared map,
the leases are how stale information decays, and the witness (witness.py) is how the map is checked
against what actually happened. That is the whole enforcement model.
