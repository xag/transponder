"""The channel and the witness, driven over the real hook wire format.

Three claims, in the order they matter:

  1. THE MAP IS COHERENT — a granted region belongs to exactly one agent, overlap is decidable,
     and a conflict names the exact intersection. A double-booked map is worse than no map,
     because it is believed.
  2. THE COURIER INFORMS AND NEVER REFUSES — an agent walking into a shared checkout gets
     introduced, once, and every call proceeds. It does NOT warn before a write: that was
     specified, built, and undeliverable, because a hook reaches an agent ahead of its tool only
     by refusing the call. The failure this project prevents was never malice, it was an agent
     that did not know another agent was there.
  3. THE WITNESS NAMES WHAT HAPPENED — a write into another agent's region is reported, loudly,
     to the agent that did it, with the remedy attached. It is a fact off the tree, not a guess
     about a command.
