"""The Claude Code adapter, driven over its real wire format — and held to the NEW contract.

The old suite asserted who got refused, when, and with what ticket in hand. All of that died with
the lock. What replaced it is one property, and it is the first test in this file because every
other behaviour is subordinate to it:

    **No tool call is ever refused.** The single exit 2 left in the library is the Stop boundary,
    where a DEPARTING session is asked once about its own dirty tree — and that blocks no other
    agent, ever.

Everything else here is the harness plumbing that has to survive for the courier and the witness
to be trustworthy: fail-open on garbage, the off switch reaching running sessions, the drift note,
and the blind-witness warning when half the install is missing.
