"""The working-copy lock: behaviour, against a real git checkout and a real lockfile.

Exclusion, reentrancy, the crashed holder, the dirty tree, the idle boundary, the stale
reader. The trajectory oracle — the half of the suite that can condemn a bug the behaviour
tests cannot stage — lives in test_oracle.py and needs the `flight` extra; this file is
pure stdlib, like the lock itself.
