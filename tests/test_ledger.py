"""The design ledger is checkable, and checked.

Two different facts, failing in two different places — which is itself the lesson of the entry these
tests now guard.

**The structural rules** (a decision names what it rejected; a hypothesis carries a falsification; a
debt carries a discharge) say the ledger is *well-formed*. They belong here, and they must be green.

**The gate** says something unsound is on the write path and has not been paid for. That is not a
broken test — it is a true statement about the project — and it belongs in `ledger.check`, which
exits 1 while the gate is red so a pipeline stops. Asserting it green here would leave exactly two
ways out the day a debt is taken on: lie in the ledger, or leave the suite permanently red. Both end
with the gate quietly becoming a caveat again, which is the failure this ledger exists to prevent.

Skips where `quern` (private) is not installed — CI and outside contributors lose nothing but this
audit; machines with the substrate run it.
