"""The design ledger: every non-obvious decision and live hypothesis, as a checkable tree.

Not a changelog. Each decision carries its rationale and the alternatives it rejected; each
hypothesis carries its own falsification criterion — so the ledger can be *checked* (see
tests/test_ledger.py), not merely read. A decision whose stated rationale no longer holds
should be discoverable by a rule, not by memory.

Authored against `bom` (the ledger substrate: kinds, rules and solvers as data). bom is a
private library, so it is NOT a dependency of this public package — the ledger check simply
skips where bom is not installed, and runs on machines that have it.
