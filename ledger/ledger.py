"""The design ledger: every non-obvious decision, live hypothesis and carried debt, as a tree a
rule can go red on.

Not a changelog. Each decision carries its rationale and the alternatives it rejected; each
hypothesis carries the observation that would kill it; each debt carries the condition under which
it is discharged, and a **gate** that stays red while it is not.

**This file used to author its own vocabulary, and that was the bug behind a bug.** It defined
`decision`, `rejected-alternative`, `hypothesis`, `falsifier` — and nothing else. So when v1's first
draft left a known hole open (a shell write detected only *after* it landed, through which two
sessions could write one checkout), there was nowhere in this vocabulary to put a known-unsound
thing. It went in as a *hypothesis*, with a "falsifier" that would fire the first time the hole cost
somebody their work.

That is not a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a belief whose outcome is genuinely unknown, killed by an
observation that costs nothing to make. A hole you have already proved reachable is a **debt**, and
a debt whose only kill-criterion is the damage it causes is not being carried — it is being hidden.
`bom.ledger` models this correctly and always did: `debt` (known-unsound, carried on purpose),
`discharge` (what clears it, and who is competent to), and `gate` (the point past which unsound
things must not travel, with `nothing-unsound-passes-a-gate` to enforce it). Re-authoring a poorer
copy of that vocabulary is what left the lie somewhere to live. So: pin the package, do not restate
it. (The hole itself is now closed in code — see `hold-the-lock-through-the-unknown`.)

Authored against `bom`, which is a private library: it is NOT a dependency of this public package.
The ledger check skips where bom is not installed, and runs on machines that have it.
