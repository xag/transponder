"""Run the ledger's rules, report what is red, and say what to do about it.

    uv run python -m ledger.check            the gate
    uv run python -m ledger.check --brief    one line per entry, fattest first

THREE OUTCOMES, THREE EXIT CODES, and the distinction is the point:

    0   green — every rule holds and the roll is written
    1   RED — something unsound is in front of the gate that nobody accounted for,
        an expectation outlived the red it excused, or an entry left the record
        without saying so. The ledger is fine; what it records is not.
        NOT on red as such: a red the node itself expects, by rule name in
        meta['expected:<rule>'], is a debt carried on purpose and prints red*
    2   CANNOT CHECK — quern is missing, the file does not parse, the pinned
        package is not in the registry. Nothing was judged

2 used to be 1, and that cost an afternoon: CI failed with `ledger@0.5.0
(pinned) is not in the library` and read as a red gate for weeks, when the truth
was that the workflow cloned a registry that had been renamed. "Unsound" and
"unchecked" are different facts and a pipeline should be able to tell them apart
without reading a traceback.

`quern` is the substrate this is authored against. It is deliberately NOT a
dependency of this package — transponder is public and its adopters must not
need it — so the check runs where someone has put it on the path. The test
suite's structural rules `importorskip` past its absence; this module does not,
because a check that silently passes when it could not run is worse than one
that is missing.

The GATE is deliberately not a unit test: a red gate does not mean the code is
broken, it means an unsound thing is being carried and has not been paid for.
Those are different facts and they should fail in different places.
